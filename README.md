# Generating-Multiple-Style-Cartoon-Images-Using-Neural-Style-Transfer-and-VGG19-Model

The user selects the cartoon style that they would like to apply to their image. This may involve choosing from a list of pre-defined cartoon styles or selecting custom parameters for the cartoonification algorithm.
The selected cartoon style is applied to the real image using an algorithm or software designed for cartoonification. The process may involve various techniques such as edge detection, color quantization, and texture synthesis to achieve the desired cartoon effect.
Once the cartoon style has been applied to the real image, a cartoonified image is generated as the output of the algorithm or software. This image should reflect the selected cartoon style and the original content of the real image.
The generated cartoonified image can be displayed on a user interface, allowing the user to preview the results of the cartoonification process. Additionally, the user may have the option to download the image for use in other applications or to share with others.
